TestingKeyboard
===============
A minimal keyboard for android testing

### Purpose
While running espresso tests on android devices we would run into troubles where the keyboard would not dismiss fast enough and would occlude buttons.

This keyboard takes up only 32dp at the bottom of your screen and can be pressed to switch back to another keyboard.

### Setup

Settings -> Language & input -> Testing Keyboard

Set as default keyboard

### Usage

Tap the keyboard to show the keyboard switcher
